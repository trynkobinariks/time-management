# GitHub Repository Setup

Follow these steps to push your local repository to GitHub:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "time-management")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have these locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Link your local repository to GitHub

After creating your repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/time-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the repository was pushed successfully

1. Refresh the GitHub page for your repository
2. You should see all your files including the README.md

## 4. Additional GitHub configurations (optional)

Consider adding these to your repository:

1. Branch protection rules
2. Issue templates
3. Pull request templates
4. GitHub Actions for CI/CD

You're now ready to collaborate on your project through GitHub!
